            <p> My name is Stephanie Jimenez and I am pursuing a degree in Professional Studies.I started in 2020 during the pandemic and completed
               the Pathways program. <br>I already acquired my TEFL certificate and this semester I will complete the courses needed for my Graphic Design certificate. 
                This class is for my last certificate in web and computer programming. I have worked very hard the past 3 years. Going back to school as an adult is never easy
                especially with so many responsibilities and commitments.I hope my hard work is noticed by my children and that they are learning how to work hard
                 to achieve their goals and dreams and that it is never too late. </p>

            <p> Arizona is the sixth largest state in the country in terms of area. 
                <br> Such spectacular landforms as the Grand Canyon and the Painted Desert have become international symbols of the regionâ€™s ruggedness. 
                <br> Arizona is located in the southwestern quadrant of the conterminous states.
